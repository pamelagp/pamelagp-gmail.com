## I wrote this code because I needed to send  +50 peronalized emails to +50 different companies using my company's Outlook email
## I have an excel file with the relevant information such as COMPANY NAME, RECIPIENTS NAME, and some other information I needed to send.
## I wrote the email template body in HTML and parse it with BeautifulSoup


### EMAIL TEMPLATE written in HTML saved in a separate file called 'email_template.html'  #####
